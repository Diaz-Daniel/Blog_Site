## Blog_Site

## Goal of the Project

To build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where people can publish blog posts, and comment on other users' posts. The site is build following the MVC paradigm in its structure and uses Handlebars.js, Sequelize and express-session npm package for authentication.

## Project Requirements

- When I visit the site then I am presented with the homepage, which includes navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard, and the option to log in;

- If I try to navigate to a different page, then I am prompted to a different page where I will be prompted to create a profile or login;

- Once I am logged in I can navigate to the dashboard to create a new blog post and edit any that have been created or delete old blog posts;

- If I navigate to the homepage I can see a list of blog posts from other users and add a comment;

- If I close the application, and try to access the site after a period of time I will be prompted to sign in again;
